        <p>I was lucky enough to be born in this great state. However, I did not realize how wonderful it was until I
            moved around the US and spent time in other places. Now I often ponder on eventually moving back to the
            place I couldn't await to escape when I was younger.<br>The pages of this website are correlated with the
            cities I have spent most of my time in North Carolina. I grew up in Mount Airy and eventually lived in
            Fayetteville for 4 years when I was in the Army. Raleigh is the state capitol and home to many prestigious
            universities.</p>
